'''-------- Automatic Grading of This HW Assignment -------
 If you have finished all the problems in this HW assignment, you could run the following command in the terminal to compute your score of this HW assignment:
     ---------------------------------------------------
     (Windows OS): python grading.py
     (Mac &Linux): python3 grading.py
     ---------------------------------------------------
 The grading.py will run all the unit tests of this HW assignment and compute the scores you get. 
 For example, if your code for this HW can get 95 points, you will see this message at the end in the terminal
 ****************************
 ** Total Points: 95 / 100 ** (this is just an example, you need to run the grading.py to know your grade)
 ****************************

 NOTE: Due to the randomness of the test data and/or initialization of parameters, the results of the same unit test may vary in different runs. If your code could pass a test case with more than 80% probability, you won't lose points in that test case. If you lose points after the grading by the TA due to randomness of the testing, you could contact the TA to show that your code could pass that test case with more than 80% chance, and get the lost points back.

 That's all! Great job! You did it!
